# meteor-jest-stubs
This is a supported fork of [orangecms/jest-meteor-stubs](https://github.com/orangecms/jest-meteor-stubs). Please note that, the package name is slightly different that the original one:

```diff
- jest-meteor-stubs
+ meteor-jest-stubs
```

## About
Testing Meteor code is very slow when using the built-in `meteor test` command.
These stubs will help you get rid of the dependencies which are not present in
your project's `node_modules` directory. Use the setup below which does most of
the actual magic. :)

## Installation
`npm i -D meteor-jest-stubs` or `yarn add -D meteor-jest-stubs`

## How it works
Jest preprocesses the files to be executed through the test runner. When pulling
in dependencies, i.e. using `require` (in ES6 `import`), similar to the default
behavior of Node.js, the resolver will look for them in a local directory named
`node_modules`. However, Meteor injects additional modules when running `meteor`
instead of plain Node.js, which do not reside in this directory. Jest allows you
to overcome this issue by providing additional locations where the load should
look for modules.

## Usage
Add this module's `lib/` directory to the `modulePaths` in your Jest config.
For Meteor packages, you will need to use `moduleNameMapper` to rewrite the
module names to use `_` instead of `:` for the namespaces as `:` is not allowed
by some file/operating systems.
The configuration has to be in `jest.config.js` in Jest 20 because of
[a bug in the mapper](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3716).

Here is a working example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.jsx?$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  moduleFileExtensions: [
    'js',
    'jsx',
  ],
  modulePaths: [
    '<rootDir>/node_modules/',
    '<rootDir>/node_modules/meteor-jest-stubs/lib/',
  ],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '^(.*):(.*)$': '$1_$2',
  },
  unmockedModulePathPatterns: [
    '/^imports\\/.*\\.jsx?$/',
    '/^node_modules/',
  ],
};
```
